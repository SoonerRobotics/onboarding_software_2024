Your game company is about to release their own version of snake and you've received some feedback 
from your beta testers.

"Please change the font, comic sans is very unprofessional!"

"Honestly not sure how the devs missed this one... the score counts down instead of up."

"The fruit is blue, what kind of fruit is blue? It should be red, like an apple!"

"If the snake is moving right, accidentally pressing A kills me!"

"I'd like to be able to play using the arrow keys."
